%Here goes the abstrat of your thesis
In the context of digital transformation, the necessity for agile, efficient, and scalable corporate information systems is paramount, with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems at the forefront of integrating and optimizing business processes. Confronted with growing complexity and the demand for flexibility, traditional ERP architectures exhibit considerable limitations. This thesis delves into the innovative realms of microservices architecture and serverless technologies, such as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and cloud services, proposing them as robust solutions to these challenges. An extensive analysis and a real-world application case study form the core of this research, focusing on the design and development of an ERP software platform tailored for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This platform not only meets the specific requirements of SMEs but also encapsulates modern concepts of distributed architecture and novel cloud-based programming paradigms. Aiming to optimize cost-effectiveness for end-users, even with a pricing model divergent from existing platforms, the study culminates in the creation of a prototype ERP system. This is achieved by integrating various cloud services and developing a cross-platform client front-end using Flutter, showcasing the viability and advantages of the proposed architectural shift. The thesis also tackles the intricacies of this technological evolution, discussing potential challenges and establishing best practices. Ultimately, it provides practitioners and business decision-makers with comprehensive insights and practical tools, supporting a successful transition to more resilient, agile, and future-ready ERP systems.
